# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders has requested to see a bike trip analysis. 

As such, we are organizing out dataset and creating a set of visualizations:-
* Showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
These are our findings.

### Checkout Times for Users

As the graph shows, most of the bikes were used for a duration of 20 mins or less.

### Checkout Times for Gender

Our customer base mostly consists of men, it would be beneficial if we market our business more towards the female demographic. This would help us get more customers.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Weekdays from 6am to 9am and in the evening from 5pm to 7pm, we have highest bike usage. Whereas in the weekend 10am to 6pm is our busiest time.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Users can easily filter according to their criteria, they just input the information into their respective fields and hit enter. The results will show up on the righthand side of the webpage, all the information will be organised in their respective columns.

## Summary
One drawback is that the filter can only look at one city at a time. For example, if someone types El Cajon they cannot serch for other cities at the same time.

Two recommendations for this project can be:-
* A sort function can be implemented (For example, dates can be sorted in ascending or descending order).
* A range function can be added (If a user wants to search specific date ranges like if someone only wants to see dates ranging from Jan to March of a certain year).
