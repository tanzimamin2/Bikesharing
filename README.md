# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders has requested to see a bike trip analysis. 

As such, we are organizing out dataset and creating a set of visualizations:-
* Showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
These are our findings.

### Checkout Times for Users

As the graph shows, most of the bikes were used for a duration of 20 mins or less.

### Checkout Times for Gender

This graph shows us bike usage times based on gender.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Weekdays from 6am to 9am and in the evening from 5pm to 7pm, we have highest bike usage. Whereas in the weekend 10am to 6pm is our busiest time.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This heatmap shows high demand times by gender during the days of the week and by hour of the day. We can conclude that males are renting more at the high demand times versus females.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

This graph shows the number of trips by weekday, by user type (subscribers versus customers) and by gender. In the subscriber category, males have higher number of trips compared to females.

### User types

This pie chart shows our user types (subscribers versus customers).

### Riders by Gender

This pie chart shows our riders by gender.


## Summary

From our analysis, we can conclude the folowing:-

* Most of the rentals happen during the weekday around normal work commute times (6am to 9am). This is very important as it shows that there is a need for transportation. If we focus on these times we can have a recurring source of revenue as well as customers.
* Our customer base mostly consists of men, it would be beneficial if we market our business more towards the female demographic. This would help us get more customers
* As seen on our User type graph above, we can see that we have more subscribers versus customers. A good portion of our customers have become subscibers, if we provide more perks and lower costs more of our one time customers will convert to subscribers. This will provide us a sustainable source of revenue.
